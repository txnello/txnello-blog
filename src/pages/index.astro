	I’m a practical, curious, and thoughtful person with a rational mindset, but I’m also driven by the need to explore and find new inspiration — in both work and everyday life. I love traveling and experiencing places that feel different from what I’m used to. So far, I’ve been to

	Sports play a key role in keeping me balanced. I’m a big football fan ⚽, but I also swim regularly 🏊‍♂️. I’m not obsessed with competing, but I enjoy being challenged — especially when it tests me both physically and mentally.

	I'm a backend developer with a strong interest in secure coding and building systems that are reliable and maintainable over time. I’ve also spent some time exploring mobile development, mostly with Flutter, for side projects or experiments. I like to work methodically, think things through, and take the time to do things properly. I'm not into chasing trends — I care about what works, what makes sense, and what adds real value.
