                    I am a backend developer with a practical and rational approach, driven by curiosity and a constant desire to explore new ideas and perspectives. I focus on building reliable and maintainable systems, with a strong interest in secure coding and long-term sustainability of software. I value methodical work, thoughtful decision-making, and solutions that make sense in practice. I do not chase trends; I focus on what works, what lasts, and what delivers real value.
